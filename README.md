## Background

The project features a sophisticated login system, implemented using jQuery, that provides users with secure access to their personalised accounts. Versety was designed to be accessible to a broad audience, allowing anyone to sign up and utilise its platform.


## Project Status

The project is still active and running; however, I stopped working on it as the base PHP language used was not up to date, and the technologies employed were not the latest and greatest, which caused efficiency issues. Considering that PHP 5 is losing support, there is not much motivation to continue working on the current codebase. However, there is potential for this project to be revived and modernized with technologies like React, which could significantly enhance its performance and usability.

## Development and Usage

Versety's development spanned from 2017 to 2019 and incorporated a diverse range of programming languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and SQL.

The project was initiated to simplify the complex task of managing academic assignments and deadlines, and it evolved over time to accommodate the needs of its user base. Although the active development phase has concluded, the project remains operational, and there is potential for future improvements to enhance its functionality and user experience.

During its active usage period, Versety served the needs of approximately 30 students throughout the year. Continuous improvement and feature enhancements were key aspects of the project's development strategy. Regular feedback from users was instrumental in identifying and addressing issues, as well as adding new features to enhance the platform's utility.
